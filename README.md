# Identification of Certain entities of each events from the dataset
In our day to day life, we come across various news articles on the Internet specially on. We remember the events and entities from the news as an important perspective. When another news is read, these events and entities create a context at users end. When a document is processed the context of events and entities has to be considered. The context of the event or entity can be derived using conditional probability principle. The more important the entity or event is, less is the uncertainty. This paper proposed a method to derive uncertainty of  entities  in events with respect to context. The proposed method has been applied on news dataset created using Twitter data and proves to be useful  for identification of important events and entities from the document.
